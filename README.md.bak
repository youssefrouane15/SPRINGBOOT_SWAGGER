# SPRINGBOOT_DATA_REST_CRUD_API
A sample springboot Crud API built with spring (data &amp; rest)

- As you may notice the controller were not created as spring rest can generate
- CRUD endpoints with its own logic (the entity name to a plural form as base-url for the API)
- you may also notice that the resource path was overriden in the dao layer as spring
- rest provides this option
